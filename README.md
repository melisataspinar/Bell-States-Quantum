In this notebook, I implement the quantum circuits that produce the four Bell states. 

I then execute each circuit on a simulator, and plot the histogram of the probability distributions for each state. 

Finally, I obtain the state vector for each state and plot it on the Bloch sphere.

I use IBM Quantum Lab and Qiskit as I am dealing with quantum computing.
